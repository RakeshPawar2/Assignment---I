#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
A=int(input("Enetr the first Number: "))
B=int(input("Enetr the second Number: "))

#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

print("\nAddition: ",A+B)

print("Subtraction: ", A-B)

print("Multiplication: ",A*B)

print("Division: ",A/B)

print('''Enetr the first Number: 5
Enetr the second Number: 10

Addition:  15
Subtraction:  -5
Multiplication:  50
Division:  0.5
''')
